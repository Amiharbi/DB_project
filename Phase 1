Abstract:
As part of our Database Management class, our team has created a hotel reservation system that will allow a hotel staff member to create, read, update, 
or delete any reservation within the system. A user may run into an issue where they do not have all the rights to be able to make changes 
within the reservation system as a manager or supervisor would. Also, not all reservations can be modified 24 hours prior to check-in time.

Mission Statement:
The purpose of the hotel reservation database system is to offer a practical solution for prospective hotel guests to efficiently plan their vacation
while maintaining efficiency for hotel staff to manage all reservations. This in turn can increase both profits as a business as well as improving overall
guest experience. 

Mission Objective:
To maintain (enter, update, delete) data on hotel guests account information
To maintain (enter, update, delete) data on staff members
To maintain (enter, update, delete) data on available rooms
To maintain (enter, update, delete) data on payment information
To maintain (enter, update, delete) data on room rate
